Predicting Forward & Backward Facial Depth Maps from a Single RGB Image for Mobile 3D AR Application

Data available at http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/main.htm

Use MATLAB code provided in the above link to fit 3DMM parameters to each face image and obtain point cloud data.

Use functions in data preprocessing notebook to convert point cloud to ground truth data.

Training and model code can be found in model notebook.
